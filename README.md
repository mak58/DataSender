Hello guys.

This is a small Delphi console application that provides a ListBox grid to display the status of sending dates.

This approach is useful whenever a WebService Data is sent, or a bunch of registries are manipulated.

It uses a thread to get the main function as a callback and avoid setting specific logic inside the ListBox Form.

You may take a look at this article about this feature and a YouTube video running a simple example:
