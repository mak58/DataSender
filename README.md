Hello, guys! 👋

This is a small **Delphi console application** that provides a `ListBox` grid to display the **status of data processing or sending**.

---

## 🛠️ Overview

This approach is especially useful when:

- 🛰️ **Sending data to a WebService**
- 📋 **Processing multiple registry entries**
- ✅ **Tracking processing progress in real time**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- 🧵 A **separate thread** handles the main processing logic.
- 📤 The main function is passed as a **callback**, keeping the `ListBox` form **decoupled** from specific business logic.
- 🖥️ The `ListBox` form acts as a **reusable UI component**, ideal for various processing tasks.
